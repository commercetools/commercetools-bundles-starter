# Contribution Guide

## Prerequisites

Minimum requirements are:
 - **Node.js** version 14.
 
You can install all dependencies using `yarn` with following command:

```
yarn (or) yarn install
```

## Local Development

### Running locally
1. Create a config file similar to `example.env` and name it `default.env` or `development.env`. This can be [done also with terraform](./terraform).
1. Create dynamic bundles [product types](./resourceDefinitions/productTypes) and [types](./resourceDefinitions/types) in the CTP project. This can be [done also with terraform](./terraform).
1. Build platform-extension-static-bundles using `yarn` and then `yarn build`.
1. Run platform-extension-static-bundles with `yarn start`.

You will need to [add the extension](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-api-extensions) to your commercetools project.  This requires the outside internet (at least commercetools) to access the local server.  We recommend using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to do so.  Additionally, you could use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send requests to the local server.

### Tests

This application uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for its testing framework.  You may run the following command to run the tests:

To run the unit tests

```shell
yarn test:unit
```

To run the tests in watch mode:

```shell
yarn test:watch
```

To run the tests with coverage:

```shell
yarn test:coverage
```

#### Integration tests
Following additional environment variables must be provided in order to run the Integration tests.
