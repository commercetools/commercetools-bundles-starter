Product bundles are several goods or services that are sold to customers as a
single combined package. Bundles are presented as distinct items during the
shopping experience, typically with a unique product display page and being
offered through product listing pages or search results.

Product bundles allow for increased customer value, shopping convenience, and
increased profit through larger average order value and opportunities for better
inventory management.

A traditional bundle involves removing the items from inventory, pre-packing the
items as a group, and receiving the package under a newly created SKU. The items
are no longer able to be purchased individually. This process creates a positive
customer experience and simplifies fulfillment.

An alternative option is to create a new virtual SKU that represents the bundle.
This new SKU points to all items in the bundle. After the customer purchases the
virtual SKU, the items are packaged and delivered. This solution targets these
virtual or post-pack bundles.
